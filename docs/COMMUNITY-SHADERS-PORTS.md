# Community Shaders ports: what came from where, and under which licence

Written 2026-10-19 with the five features below. Kept so that anyone can check, file by file, that nothing was taken from a
closed or unlicensed source.

## The short version

- Every piece of outside code used here is **GPL-3.0** (Community Shaders) or **GPL-3.0-or-later** (Conor's NVR fork).
  This project is GPL-3.0-or-later with the same Modding and Linking exceptions, so the combination is allowed. The
  combined work is distributed as GPL-3.0 with its source public (this repository).
- Each ported file and function says at its top where it came from (repository, path, commit) and keeps the original
  credit. Nothing was relicensed or stripped of a notice.
- Parts written for this build (the land-height reader and its inflate, the DirectX 9 cloud shadow pass, the grass
  push texture and its CPU side, the sky-visibility channel for reflections, the composite plumbing) are this project's
  own code, under its licence.
- Not used, on purpose: the Community Shaders logo and icons (no licence for redistribution), their glints shader (origin
  unclear), any vendor SDK (DLSS, FSR, Streamline), and their shipped heightmap textures (we read the player's own game
  files at run time instead, so no game-derived data is distributed).

## Sources checked (2026-10-19)

| Source | Commit read | Licence, as checked |
|---|---|---|
| github.com/community-shaders/skyrim-community-shaders (branch `dev`) | 3f9f72d | `COPYING.txt` GPL-3.0; README "License: GPL-3.0 WITH Modding Exception AND GPL-3.0 Linking Exception"; `EXCEPTIONS.md`. Per their README, files without their own header are GPL-3.0 with the exceptions; `package/SKSE/Plugins/CommunityShaders/Licenses/THIRD_PARTY.md` lists the exceptions to that (none of the files below are on it, except SebH's spherical harmonics, MIT, which is not used here). |
| github.com/northaxosky/fallout4-community-shaders | e499056 | GPL-3.0-or-later + the same exceptions (read for the heightmap workflow only; no code taken). |
| github.com/mrfury97/Conor-sClaudeHell-NVR-SAL-Fork, branches `testbed` and `claude/terrain-variation` | 9000473d, 6043062a, bae95aef; 66653eea, d07ff4b9 | A fork of macrimmon12-tech/TESReloaded10. Its `COPYING.txt` is the GPL-3.0 text and its `License.md` is byte-for-byte this project's (GPL-3.0-or-later with the same section 7 terms). GitHub shows "Other" only because of those extra terms. |

Files of the Community Shaders features that were read (none carries its own licence header, none is in THIRD_PARTY.md,
so all are GPL-3.0 with the exceptions):

## Feature by feature

### Mountain shadows ([Shaders.ShadowsExteriors.TerrainShadows])
- `src/effects/TerrainShadows.{h,cpp}`: **Conor's code** (his `TerrainShadows.{h,cpp}` at 9000473d), itself after Community
  Shaders' Terrain Shadows. Kept: the xLODGen height-map reader, the worker-thread sweep toward the sun, the strip upload.
  Changed: a fallback to the land read from the plugins; the load request built on the main thread.
- `src/effects/LandHeights.{h,cpp}`: **this build's own code.** Reads the LAND records of a worldspace from the player's own
  plugins in load order (format from UESP / xEdit documentation) and a small zlib inflate written from RFC 1950/1951.
- `Effects/SunFar.fx.hlsl` `TerrainShadow()`, `TerrainShadowCoverage()`, `SkyIrradiance()` and the share formula: **Conor's**
  (his `ShadowsExteriors.fx.hlsl` at 6043062a). The separate pass, the composite hooks and the single-lookup cascade test are
  this build's.
- `ShadowsExteriorEffect::UpdateLightColors`: **Conor's** (6043062a).

### Cloud shadows ([Shaders.CloudShadows.Main])
- **This build's own code**, after the idea of Community Shaders' Cloud Shadows (the cover of the game's cloud layers where
  the light from a point meets the cloud layer, dimming only the sun). CS captures the layers into a cube map during the
  sky's reflection pass (D3D11); here the sky's four cloud textures are read directly on a flat layer above the camera.
  The 2 km height default is CS's `CloudHeight`.

### Grass collision ([Shaders.Grass.Collision])
- **This build's own code**, after the idea of Community Shaders' Grass Collision (actors flatten the grass round them, the
  grass vertex shader bends away, a spring brings it back). CS uses a compute shader and a constant buffer; here the CPU
  keeps a world-locked push grid and the grass vertex shaders read it as a vertex texture.

### Less repeating ground ([Shaders.Terrain.Variation])
- `Shaders/Includes/TerrainVariation.hlsl`: **Conor's port** (66653eea, d07ff4b9) of Community Shaders' Terrain Variation:
  the skewed lattice, the hash, the corner ranking and fades, the height-weighted blend (constants identical to CS's
  `TerrainVariation.hlsli`). After Deliot and Heitz, "Procedural Stochastic Textures by Tiling and Blending" (2019).
  Changed: the taps use this build's explicit gradients and empty-layer skip; StartDistance; register c95.

### Sky reflections under cover ([Shaders.AmbientOcclusion.Skylighting] Reflections)
- **This build's own code**: Skylighting v2's visibility kept in a spare channel and applied to the Specular effect's sky
  reflection and to the sky fallback of the wet-ground reflections. The blend `lerp(MinReflection, 1, visibility)` and its
  0.1 default follow Community Shaders' Skylighting `MixSpecular` / `MinSpecularVisibility`.
