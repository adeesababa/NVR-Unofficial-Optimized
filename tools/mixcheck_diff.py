"""mixcheck_diff.py <NewVegasReloaded_*.log> [bad mode substring] [good mode substring]

UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-30, for [Main.Main.Performance] NvrDxvkMixCheck (src/core/MixCheck.h). A normal frame already logs many MIXCHECK lines
(cached shadow cubes and atlas cascades, ping-pong history buffers, the first frames after a load): the broken edge is what one mode logs and
the others do not. Each MIXCHECK line ends with its mode, e.g. [passes Vulkan, keep "CombineDepth,Normals"]. This prints, per mode, the
(image, reader, kind) lines no other mode has (the reader's D3D9 / Vulkan path ignored, so a kept effect matches itself), and the setup line.
With a bad and a good mode substring given, only bad-minus-good. Run the game once with the failing NvrDxvkKeepD3D9 list, switch the list to
empty in the menu (or launch again with it empty), and give this the log.
