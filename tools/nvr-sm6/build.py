r"""
build.py: compile every pass listed in passes.txt (tools/nvr-sm6) to SPIR-V for the NVR DXVK fork, one file per variant of the
compile-time defines EffectRecord::BuildMacros passes to the effects (only the defines the effect's sources test), into
src/hlsl/NewVegas/Compute/Sm6 (deployed as Data\Shaders\NewVegasReloaded\Compute\Sm6). UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-26 (deep/fork-sm6).

  python3 tools/nvr-sm6/build.py            (Linux/WSL; glslang + spirv-val in ~/vktools/root/usr/bin or on PATH)

Re-run it after changing an effect (or an include) that has an SM6 build: NVR refuses a .spv whose recorded source hashes no
longer match the deployed .hlsl (logged; the D3D9 pass is used), so a forgotten rebuild shows up as "stale", never as a wrong picture.

Per pass: <Effect>.<Technique>.<Pass>.txt (the index: which defines matter) and per variant <...>.<key>.spv + <...>.<key>.txt
(the layout). key = FNV-1a 32 of "NAME=VALUE;NAME-;..." over the index's defines in that order (NAME- = not defined), the same
string core/Sm6Pass.cpp builds from the defines the effect was compiled with.
