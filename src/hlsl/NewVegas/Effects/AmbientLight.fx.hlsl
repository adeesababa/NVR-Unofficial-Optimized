// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-14: ambient occlusion and bounce light in one pass ([Shaders.AmbientLight], src/effects/AmbientLight.cpp).
// While it is on it replaces the AmbientOcclusion and BounceLight effects (ShaderManager skips them).
//
// Both come from the same reads: for each half-resolution pixel, two directions across the screen (turned per pixel by blue
// noise), four reads each way along each. Along every direction the highest the surroundings rise above the pixel's surface (its
// "horizon") gives how much of the sky above the pixel they hide: ambient occlusion, worked out as in "Practical Real-Time
// Strategies for Accurate Indirect Occlusion" (Jimenez et al. 2016, GTAO), cosine-weighted, so creases darken and open ground
// does not. Each read also sends the light it shows on screen to the pixel, as far as it rises above the pixel's surface and the
// two face each other: the bounce light (first after "Horizon-based indirect lighting", Mayaux 2018, counting only the part of
// the view each read newly covered; UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-14 every read counts smoothly instead, see Estimate: far less shimmer).
//
// Pass 1 Prepare (half): depth, normal and colour of each half-resolution pixel packed into one texel (as BounceLight's), so
//        each read of the estimate is one small texel.
// Pass 2 Estimate (half): rgb = bounce light, a = visibility (1 open, 0 fully hidden).
// Pass 3-4 Blur (half): depth-aware, horizontal then vertical, all four channels.
// Pass 5 Accumulate (half, UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-14, user: "shimmers really hard above 1 bounce strength", worst on grass): the
//        bounce light blended into last frame's at the same spot (found by reprojection, kept only where the depth there
//        matches, less of it the further the spot moved, and held within the range of the bounce round it now so swaying grass
//        does not smear). With it the estimate's noise turns every frame, so the frames average out. rgb = bounce, a = view depth
//        (next frame's match). Off ([Shaders.AmbientLight.Main] Temporal) or after a break: this frame's bounce as it is.
// Pass 6 Apply (full): depth-aware upsample; the scene darkened by the occlusion (less on bright surfaces, as the old AO) and the
//        bounce added, times the surface's own colour as one picture tells it (SurfaceColour; there is no albedo buffer).
//
// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-14 cheaper: outdoors, the sun-shadow apply (ShadowsExteriors.fx.hlsl, a full-resolution pass of its own while
// this effect is on) is done here instead (NVR_ALFlags.x): in Apply before the occlusion, and in Prepare on the colour the bounce
// light is gathered from, so both see the scene as they did after that pass. The blurs and the apply take their depths from the
// depth buffer (4 bytes a read) instead of the 16-byte prepared texel.
//

// Now the AO's sky pass runs just before this effect (ShaderManager) and technique AmbientLightSky (the end of the file) applies its
// factor in Apply, as the AO's combine does. Without the sky the first technique runs, unchanged. (Measured 2026-10-20: the same test

//  - ShadowManager draws a small depth map of the world from the sun round the grid (NVR_GridSunDepth, every few frames

//    spherical harmonics: one number for all directions and three for the direction; the light's colour is the sun's x

//    a step; the total over the steps is the bounce light (NVR_GridAccum).
