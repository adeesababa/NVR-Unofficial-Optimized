// UNOFFICIAL, optional (off by default): one bounce of indirect light, gathered from the screen.
// Written from scratch for this build, after the general idea of screen-space indirect lighting.
//
// Passes 1-4 run at half (QuarterResolution: quarter) resolution into the effect's own buffers (BounceLight.cpp).
// Pass 1 (Prepare): depth, normal and colour of each low-resolution pixel packed into one texel (see Prepare).
// Pass 2 (Gather, rgb = bounced light, a = view depth of the pixel it belongs to): for each pixel, 8 points on a disc around it in its tangent plane (lifted slightly off the
// surface), each projected to the screen. The surface found there sends the light it shows on screen back toward
// the pixel, weighted by how much each faces the other and by how close it is to the point aimed at. Rotated per
// pixel by blue noise. The disc is kept within a small part of the screen: close up, a full-size disc would read
// pixels scattered over the whole screen, which is very slow (texture cache misses) and pulls in unrelated colour.
// Passes 3-4: depth-aware blur, horizontal then vertical, to smooth out the noise.
// Pass 5 (Combine, full resolution): depth-aware upsample, then the bounced light added to the scene, tinted by
// the receiving surface's own hue (there is no albedo buffer, so the hue of the pixel stands in for it).
//
// Screen-space limits: only light from things visible on screen bounces, and it fades at the screen edges.
// The first-person weapon and anything touching the camera neither receive nor send bounce light.
//
// UNOFFICIAL additions, each switchable ([Shaders.BounceLight.Main] OffScreenLight, MultiBounce, Temporal, HalfSamples);
// with all of them off BounceLight.cpp runs the first technique, exactly as before. The other techniques have the same
// five passes, buffers and result (so Specular's SpecularBounce combine takes them unchanged):
// - BounceLightPlus: Prepare and Gather with the off-screen light and the extra bounces (below).
// - BounceLightTemporal (8 samples a frame) and BounceLightTemporalHalf (4): the same, plus last frame's bounce reused.
//   The sample pattern turns from frame to frame, and each frame's gather is blended into last frame's at the same spot
//   (found by reprojection; not where the depth there does not match: something moved in front, or came into view).
//   NVR_BounceHistory is last frame's gather then; this frame's goes to the other history buffer.
// Off-screen light: a sample that leaves the screen (or lands on the first-person weapon) used to add nothing, which
//   darkened the bounce toward the screen edges and round the weapon. Its surface is unknown: it is now taken to face
//   the pixel as the seen samples' surfaces do on average, and to send light between the ambient light's (the weather's
//   outdoors, the cell's indoors) and the seen samples' average.
// Extra bounces: in Prepare, the bounce light each surface showed last frame (what Combine added to it) joins the light
//   it sends on, so light keeps bouncing, one more time each frame.
// UNOFFICIAL NeonSpill ([Shaders.BounceLight.Main] NeonSpill, 0: off): long-range light from bright lights (neon signs,
//   lamps, fires) onto the surfaces round them, the look of the screen-space "RTGI" shaders. After ZN_FX's SDIL/DAMP RT
//   (Zenteon, GPL-3, github.com/Zenteon/ZN_FX): instead of tracing rays, each direction reads ever smaller, blurrier
//   copies of the screen at ever greater distances, so it reaches far for a few reads. Here:
//   - BounceSpillPyramid builds the copies: level 0 320 texels wide (whatever the screen's size, so the reach is the same
//     share of the screen at any resolution), each next level half the one before, seven in all. Only what is bright
//     enough to count as a light goes in (SpillLight), with its depth.
//   - GatherPlus then reads them along 8 directions round each pixel, one read per level, 1.5 texels of that level out
//     (so the reads of neighbouring directions overlap and a small sign is not missed between them), and adds the light
//     each read area sends to the pixel: its light times its size seen from the pixel (the area it stands for on screen,
//     made world size at its depth), times how much the pixel faces it, unless something nearer along the same
//     direction rises higher (a wall, a kerb, a car in between).
//   - BounceSpillGather does that per low-resolution pixel into a buffer of its own, with a memory: blended into last
//     frame's at the same spot (no flicker from a small lamp that some frames' reads hit and others miss); and while the
//     view moves, a spot's light may fade no faster than over NeonSpillMemory seconds (it may still rise at once), so the
//     light of a sign that goes off screen as the view turns lingers and fades instead of vanishing. With the view still
//     it follows the lights as they are, so a sign that blinks still blinks. GatherPlus adds the buffer.
//   - What counts as a light (SpillLight) is relative to the scene's own light: brighter than LightLevel times a white
//     surface lit by the sky and the sun or moon outdoors, or by the cell's light indoors (BounceLight.cpp, NVR_SpillMemory.w).
//     Nothing measured on screen, so it does not change as you turn or zoom: a level taken from the screen's average
//     made lights flicker in and out as the view moved, and a lamp you zoomed in on raised it until it stopped counting.
//   - NeonSpillNear and NeonSpillFar weigh the reads close to a pixel and far from it (between them in steps, read by
//     read): the close ones make the glow right round a light (strong round a small, bright sign), the far ones carry big
//     signs' light down the street. NeonSpillBrightCap limits how bright a light counts (in multiples of the light test),
//     so a tiny glaring bulb cannot outshine a big sign. Pixels that are themselves lights get no spill: a sign's own face
//     lit by its tubes washed it out.
//   - NeonSpillSeparateDepth (technique BounceSpillGatherSeparate; 0: as before): a read's light is placed at its own depth and
//     on-screen spot, not at a depth mixed with the empty texels round it (what stands in the way), and light that may lie on the
//     receiving pixel's own plane (within a quarter texel of where it is read) does not count: a sign no longer lights the flat
//     wall or panel it is painted on, the street keeps its light (SpillStepSeparate).
//   - NeonSpillMaskSpillOnly (0: as before): the test that keeps light pixels from being lit is applied to the spill alone (in
//     GatherPlus), not to all the bounce in Combine. NeonSpillCapSceneLight (BounceLight.cpp only): NeonSpillBrightCap counts in
//     multiples of the scene's own light, not of the light test, so a stricter LightLevel no longer lets very bright lights
//     spill MORE (their spill used to grow with the light test).
//   - NeonSpillHoldAfterTurn (seconds, 0: as before): the memory's hold, which only works while the view moves, keeps working that
//     long after the view stops, so the light of a sign turned off screen fades instead of draining in a few frames.
//   The result joins the short-range bounce in the gather, so the blur, temporal reuse and combine take it as it is. With
//   NeonSpill on, BounceLight.cpp always runs one of the techniques with GatherPlus and its own combine.
