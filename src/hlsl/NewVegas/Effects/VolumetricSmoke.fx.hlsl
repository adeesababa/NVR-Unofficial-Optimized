// GunFX volumetric smoke (prototype).
// GunFX.dll keeps its smoke (heat smoke, after-fire trail, muzzle puffs, ejection smoke) as chains of points in world
// space and hands over one record per tube segment between neighbouring points (or per lone point, a soft sphere).
// Every segment is a Gaussian tube (density falls off with distance from its axis, radius and density blended along
// it), integrated along the view ray in closed form at the ray's closest approach, so the smoke is one continuous
// volume however far apart the points are.
// Two steps: VolumetricSmokeSegments draws each segment as a screen quad over the area it can reach and adds into
// TESR_SmokeBuffer its optical depth (r), the share of it the light reaches (g), the muzzle flash's light on it (b)
// and its age (a),
// so the cost follows the smoke's size on screen, not the number of segments; VolumetricSmoke then lights the total and
// lays it over the image. Look: noise attached to the smoke makes its outline lumpy and eats into its edges (more as
// it ages); light passing through the smoke toward the sun (indoors: from above) leaves the far side darker, and the
// smoke glows when you look toward the sun; each shot's muzzle flash lights the smoke around it; fresh smoke is whiter
// and greys with age, thin smoke has a cool tint and light through it warms slightly; it is shaded as if round and
// lumpy (lit side and top brighter, lumps catching light on one side), for a sense of depth; it takes its ambient light from
// the view, is darker deep inside, fades behind scene surfaces and close to the camera, and your own first-person gun
// stays in front of it.
