// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-28 CapturedNormals, the readers' side (core/CapturedNormals.h, docs/next/CAPTURED-NORMALS.md). While the world's main
// opaque list draws, NVR's lit templates write their smooth vertex normal (world space, before the normal map) into
// TESR_CapturedNormalsBuffer: rg octahedral, b the camera distance, a 1 where written (Shaders/Includes/CapturedNormals.hlsl).
// Declare first, in your samplers' order (they bind by declaration order):
//   sampler2D TESR_CapturedNormalsBuffer : register(sN) = sampler_state { ADDRESSU = CLAMP; ADDRESSV = CLAMP; MAGFILTER = POINT; MINFILTER = POINT; MIPFILTER = NONE; };
// CapturedNormal(uv, distance, n): true and the normal where this pixel's surface wrote one and its distance matches the depth buffer's
// (distance = length of the pixel's camera vector, toWorld(uv) * readDepth(uv)); false anywhere else (the game's own shaders, see-through
// and blended things, water, grass, decals and particles drawn later, MSAA edges, the first person): keep the depth-rebuilt normal there.
// uv: rect coordinates, as every full-screen pass's (RenderScale v2 frames: the world is drawn into the same top-left part).
