// UNOFFICIAL: volumetric clouds -- a layer of real 3D clouds high above the ground, marched through and lit by the sun,
// in place of the game's flat cloud pictures. After "The real-time volumetric cloudscapes of Horizon Zero Dawn"
// (Schneider, SIGGRAPH 2015) and "Physically based sky, atmosphere and cloud rendering in Frostbite" (Hillaire, 2016).
//
// Three techniques, driven by VolumetricCloudsEffect (src/effects/VolumetricClouds.cpp):
//   1 March     (one texel per 2 x 2 block of the quarter resolution, TESR_CloudCurrent): along the view ray of one
//               quarter-resolution pixel of each block (a different one each frame, all four in four frames) through the
//               cloud layer (a shell round a curved earth, so the clouds sink toward the horizon), at most Steps samples
//               of the cloud density, each lit by a short march toward the sun. Each frame starts the samples at a
//               different offset (blue noise). rgb: light the clouds send toward the eye (linear), a: how much of the sky
//               behind still shows.
//   2 Temporal  (quarter resolution, into the history): the pixel marched this frame blends its new value into its
//               history; the other three keep theirs. Either way the history is found again where the camera turned
//               (the clouds are far enough away that only the turn matters) and kept within this frame's neighbourhood,
//               so nothing smears. That averages the march's grain away at a quarter of its cost.
//   3 ShadowMap (UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-12, Shadows on; 256 x 256, TESR_CloudShadow): looking down on the cloud base round the
//               camera (ShadowRange across), how much sunlight gets through the layer at each point along the light: eight
//               density reads per texel (the full shape with its eroded edges, as the clouds seen). The centre snaps to whole texels so the map does not crawl as the camera moves.
//   0 Composite (full resolution, in the frame chain): the history over the sky (only where the depth buffer shows sky).
//               UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-12, everywhere else: the cloud shadow (the shadow map where the light from this point
//               meets the cloud base) and, on water, the clouds along the reflected view (WaterReflections): read from the
//               history where that direction is on screen and shows sky there, through the water's Fresnel term.
//
// Shapes come from three tiling noise textures made by tools/cloud_noise.cpp: CloudShape (big billows, 3D), CloudDetail
// (wisps, 3D) and CloudWeather (2D: where clouds may form, their type, their density). The weather's coverage, from the
// game's weather type, decides how much of the sky they fill. Units are metres (70 game units each).
// The frame here is gamma encoded HDR (VolumetricFog linearises it the same way): the clouds are added in linear light.
