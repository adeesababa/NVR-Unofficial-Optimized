// UNOFFICIAL, optional (Shaders.BloodFlow, off by default): blood that runs like a liquid, dries, and pools under bodies.
// BloodFlow.cpp sends the game's blood splats and the bodies' pools as items. Two passes:
//  - BloodFlowProbe (ProbePS): for each item, into a small path texture, where its streams of blood go. Each stream
//    starts on the splat's lower part and is walked down the surface the depth buffer shows, step by step, the way
//    gravity pulls along that surface (straight down a wall, slantwise across a slope, round a rock). It stops where the
//    surface turns flat (the blood gathers there: on a ledge, at the foot of a wall) or comes to an edge with nothing
//    under it (the blood hangs there and falls in drops; the drops' landing place is found the same way). A pool finds
//    the slope of the ground round it, and trickles run off its downhill side. Once a path has been seen whole for a
//    few frames it is kept, so it does not move when the camera does.
//  - BloodFlow (BloodPS): a box round each item; every pixel in it finds its surface point from the depth buffer and
//    paints what reaches it: the streams (thin trails with a bead at the front, running over the first seconds and
//    slowing), the puddles they end in, the drop hanging at an edge, drops falling (drawn in the air, in front of what
//    is behind them) and the stain where they land; the pool, stretched downhill on a slope. Blended into the image.
// The blood's colour is the light at the pixel (worked out from the image) times the blood's own colour: a thin film
// is a dark red stain the surface shows through, a thick layer is the blood's own dark red. Fresh blood shines a little
// (the sun where it is not shaded, the lamps); dried blood is darker, browner and matte. Nothing glows.
//
// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-13 rewrite of the flow and the look (user's brief; WetWorld's scrolling rain streaks and puddles in
// hollows, by Boomstick and Mac, as the reference):
//  - Direction: each step runs along cross(cross(N, down), N), the steepest way down the surface (N x down alone runs
//    level, along the slope).
//  - Round obstacles, into valleys: the depth buffer is read as a height map round each step (Relief: how far the surface
//    there stands out of, or sinks below, the plane the blood is on). The blood leans toward the lower side, so it keeps to
//    grooves and gutters; something raised straight ahead turns it aside, to the lower side, or (no lower side) to the
//    stream's own side, so a splat's streams split round a rock or a pipe and meet below it.
//  - Motion: inside each stream the rain-streak texture is scrolled down the path (a flow map in two phases, as WetWorld's
//    lanes), each part at its own speed and drifting sideways by a smooth noise (the 3D noise texture): the blood creeps
//    and bunches unevenly instead of sliding as one sheet. Its front is lumpy and swells into a bead.
//  - Amount: every stream, puddle and pool is a thickness field (thickest in the middle, ragged by the same noise); what
//    shows is where it is thicker than a threshold (BloodAmount), so less blood breaks up into beads and clumps rather
//    than shrinking evenly. Puddles and pools reach further into the hollows round them and stay off bumps.
//  - Look: deep red; light passes through the layer (red the most) and back, so thin films and edges are a lighter,
//    saturated red and thick blood is dark (a sub-surface look); low roughness GGX highlights from the sun and lamps, a
//    sky reflection at low angles outdoors, and a red glow through thin blood when the sun is behind it.
// Settings: FlowSpeed, Viscosity (how much the noise distorts the flow: higher = slower to even out, more clumps), BloodAmount.
