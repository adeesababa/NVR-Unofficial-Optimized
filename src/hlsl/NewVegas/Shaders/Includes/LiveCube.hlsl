// UNOFFICIAL: the live surroundings cube for the object shaders -- metal (Object.hlsl getMetalAmbient, ObjectTemplate.hlsl) and
// the env-map pass (EnvTemplate.hlsl). The cube is built by the Reflections effect (src/effects/Reflections.cpp, CubeMap):
// a small cube round the camera, from what was on screen in each direction (Effects/Reflections.fx.hlsl Capture/Filter),
// blurred into mips by roughness. It is one frame old when the objects read it. Premultiplied: rgb = linear colour x
// coverage, a = coverage (0 where nothing was seen yet).
// TESR_EnvCube (PBRShaders::UpdateConstants): x metal's share ([Shaders.PBR.Metal] CubeReflections), y the env-map pass's
// ([Shaders.PBR.EnvMaps] CubeReflections), both 0 while the cube is not kept up (Reflections off, CubeMap off); z the last
// mip level. The sampler is never read while its share is 0, so what else may sit on s10 then does not matter.
// s10: free in the object shaders (game samplers s0-s7, the sun atlas s9, the interior shadow cubes s8 and s11-s15); taken
// by the sun cross-fade's old atlas when SUN_CROSSFADE is on, so the includer leaves this out then.
