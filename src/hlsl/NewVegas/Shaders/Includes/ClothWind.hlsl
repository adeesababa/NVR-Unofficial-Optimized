// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-16 cloth wind ([Shaders.Cloth.Main], core/ClothWind.h): capes, dusters, flags, banners, curtains move in the
// wind by maths in the vertex shader alone -- no physics, no CPU work per vertex. Which objects: textures whose path holds one of
// the Keywords (per draw, by NVR). Vertex shaders only (ObjectTemplate, Shadows\ShadowMap.vso).
//
// Per draw NVR sets (vertex shader constants; strength 0 = this draw is not cloth and nothing below runs):
//   c248 ClothA: x strength 0-1, y mask (0 vertex colour RED: 1 = loose, 0 = pinned; 1 = whole mesh; 2 = by height: pinned at the
//                top, loosest at the bottom -- for meshes without an authored red mask; 3 = the same by the vertex's BIND-POSE
//                height (the mesh's own position before skinning: worn clothing; independent of the pose, the actor's place and
//                the space the bones put it in); the fraction above 3 is the height (/1000) below which legs and boots stay still), z ripple 0-1, w flutter 0-1
//   c249 ClothB: xyz wind direction in the vertex shader's space (unit), w cycles per unit along the wind (1 / wavelength)
//   c250 ClothC: x main wave phase, y gust phase, z/w flutter phases -- in cycles, wrapped on the CPU (double precision), so the
//                motion never jitters after long play
//   c251 ClothD: x intensity (units), y ripple cycles per unit, z top height (mask 2), w 1 / (top - bottom) (mask 2)
//   c252 ClothE: (2026-10-19) worn clothing follows its wearer: xyz the offset (units: trailing behind the movement + the stride
//                swish) -- 0 for everything but worn clothing
//   c253 ClothF: the lag behind a turn as a small turn of the garment's bind-pose position around its upright axis, carried into
//                the vertex shader's space by the wearer's heading: turn = bind.x * xy + bind.y * zw (x/y only)
//   c226-c237 ClothLimb (2026-10-19, mask 4 = worn clothing by its own skeleton): the garment's hip, knee, ankle, toe tip (left,
//                right) and elbow, wrist (left, right) where its bones sat when it was made (the mesh's own space, as IN.position),
//                w the limb's radius there;  c238 ClothLimbParams: x hip height, y 1 / (hip - knee height), z gap off the limb where
//                cloth starts to move, w 1 / fade;  c239 ClothLimbGround: x the height below which nothing moves, y 1 / its fade,
//                zw (mask 5) the wearer's upright axis in the bind pose (between the hip joints)
//   mask 5 (2026-10-19 round 5, worn clothing): the per-vertex weight NVR worked out from the garment's own mesh (core/ClothWeights.h:
//                trouser legs and boots 0, the coat pinned at the hips and loosest at the hem, its shell and lining averaged together),
//                read from vertex stream 1 (TEXCOORD7, bound only for those draws: core/ClothWind.h DrawPartition); the billow part of
//                the wind pushes AWAY FROM THE WEARER'S UPRIGHT AXIS instead of along the vertex normal -- a lining's normal points
//                inward, so the normal billow pushed shell and lining apart (up to ~17 units in a gale). The caller passes that
//                direction already carried into the skinned space (ClothOutwardBind, through the bones).
//                (2026-10-19 round 6) That billow is ONE-SIDED: outward as before, inward softly limited to ClothBillowIn units --
//                it swung both ways by up to (ripple + flutter) x intensity, and its inward half pushed the coat into the legs (60 units
//                at 30 units of wind with ripple and flutter 1). The weight already scales with the coat's clearance from the body.
//                (2026-10-19 round 7) The same soft limit on the inward part of the WHOLE displacement (push + billow + the wearer's
//                motion): the push along the wind and the motion trail are two-way too, and on the windward side they still pressed
//                the coat 4-8 units into the legs at 30 units of wind. Sideways (around the wearer) and outward stay as they were.
//                (2026-10-19 round 8) Then a limit per LEG (thigh / calf axis, ClothLimb, the garment's measured radius): 'towards the
//                wearer's axis' alone let a panel in front of a knee but off the centre line slide sideways onto that knee (offline: a
//                BoS scribe robe panel 1.1 units into its leg core). It lets the cloth go towards a leg only as far as it still ends
//                ClothLegMargin off the leg's surface (ClothLegLimit). The legs are worked out in the bind pose and carried into the
//                skinned space by the same bones as the billow's direction (the caller passes them).
//   (2026-10-20 round 9) the walking simulation (core/ClothWalk.h, core/ClothWind.h WalkOf / WalkConstants), when c219.x is 1: the
//                garment's own skin weights glue a coat's skirt to the leg bones (it moved like trousers), so the caller lets each coat
//                vertex HANG FROM THE HIPS -- its skinned place blended towards the pelvis bone's alone (c200-c202) by weight x hang
//                (c219.y) -- adds the hem ring's displacement at the vertex's angle (c203-c218, between the two nearest of 16 points;
//                stream 1's second float is the vertex's place on the ring) under the weight like the wearer's motion, works round 8's
//                leg limits out against the CURRENT legs (c220-c225, xyz in the shader's space, w the garment's measured radius), and
//                then keeps the vertex out of those legs (ClothLegPush): pushed OUTWARD (away from the wearer's axis, the same way for a
//                shell and its lining) across the leg, smoothly (nothing well outside, never more for a point further out: layers keep
//                their order), on a leg's inner half only once inside it. Offline: bench\deep-roadmap\evidence\cloth3\cloth_walk_check.py.
//                (2026-10-20 round 9b) The ring moves each vertex by its PENDULUM share (stream 1's third float: 0 at the hips rising
//                evenly to 1 at the hem), added after the wind -- by the cloth weight (full from the knee down) the lower coat moved as
//                one stiff block and folded at the knee; and where the outward direction runs along a leg (a calf kicked up level
//                behind at a run) the push goes straight off the leg instead (radially: over the calf).
//   mask 6 (2026-10-20, still cloth: tents, flags, banners; user: 'the entire tent mesh wobbles around'): the per-vertex weight NVR
//                worked out from the still mesh's own shape (core/ClothStatic.h: poles, ropes and solid parts 0, the cloth held where it
//                touches them, the ground and its top line, loosest at its free edges), read from vertex stream 1 like mask 5 (TEXCOORD7:
//                weight, the billow's side); the billow goes along the normal x that side (+1 / -1), so the two layers of two-sided cloth
//                (whose normals face apart) billow the same way. The callers pass the side as out5.x. Mask 2 (by height) stays for
//                StillWeights off: it moved the bottom most -- a tent's poles, its ropes and the canvas on the ground.
// The same function runs in every pass of the object (the extra lamp passes test depth EQUAL, so they must land on the same spot)
// and in the shadow maps.
//
// Wave shape: Crytek's smooth triangle wave (Sousa, "Vegetation Procedural Animation and Shading in Crysis", GPU Gems 3 ch. 16,
// 2007) -- cheaper than sin() and smooth. Normals: rebuilt from two moved neighbours (finite differences along the tangent and
// the binormal), so lighting and shadows follow the folds.
