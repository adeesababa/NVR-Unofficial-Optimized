// Skin lighting for SkinTemplate.hlsl (UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-25, the skin shader rewritten on this build's own stack).
//
// Built from the includes every other lit surface in this build uses: the BRDF terms of PBR.hlsl (Fresnel, GGX through
// BRDF(), the geometric specular anti-aliasing, the split-sum environment response), the light and ambient strengths of
// PBRScale.hlsl, the sky of SkyAmbient.hlsl, linear lighting (LinearLight.hlsl) and the lamps' falloff (LampFalloff.hlsl).
// The sun's and the lamps' shadows come from Shadow.hlsl and PointShadowForward.hlsl in the template. What skin adds, and
// where it comes from:
//   - Diffusion under the skin: Penner's pre-integrated skin (GPU Pro 2, 2011) over d'Eon's measured diffusion profile
//     (GPU Gems 3 ch. 14), evaluated as the irradiance of a spherical Gaussian whose sharpness follows the surface's
//     curvature (Hill's closed form for an SG's cosine irradiance, from MJP's "SG Series" part 3). The sharpness constants
//     below were fitted for this build to the pre-integrated table, per colour, over radii 1-50 mm (bench scratch
//     fit_skin.py: largest error 0.07 red, 0.016 green, 0.008 blue; red's miss is the light that goes right round a 1 mm
//     sphere, which the transmission term carries instead). Fine relief is softened per colour with a blurred normal
//     (Penner's second technique). The curvature is measured from screen-space derivatives.
//   - Light through thin parts (ears, nostrils, fingers) against the light: Barre-Brisebois & Bouchard's approximation
//     (GDC 2011), coloured by Jimenez's transmittance of d'Eon's profile (Separable SSS, 2012), the thickness read off the
//     curvature. White at the thinnest rims, orange, then deep red.
//   - Highlights: two GGX lobes at skin's F0 of 0.028 (Jimenez 2015; Unreal's skin model: 0.75 x and 1.3 x the roughness,
//     mixed 0.85 / 0.15) through PBR.hlsl's BRDF, so they take the same masking term and specular anti-aliasing as the
//     objects next to the skin; and a sheen lobe for the fuzz on skin (Estevez & Kulla's "Charlie" distribution, Neubelt's
//     visibility). The light the highlight reflects does not also enter the skin (diffuse x (1 - F)).
//   - Shadow edges: the penumbra reddened per colour (light carried under the skin across the shadow line; bounded, and
//     only on penumbrae a few pixels wide, since 2026-10-27), and the skin's own far side lets the scattered light through
//     the shadow map's self-shadow near its terminator (SkinTemplate: a second, coarse tap toward the sun says whether a
//     shadow is the surface's own).
//   - Sky: the sky light from SkyAmbient.hlsl's harmonics, softened per colour like the direct light, and a dual-lobe sky
//     reflection with the same response as the highlights.
//
// Colour space: everything here works in the build's lighting space (the game's gamma, or linear with [Shaders.PBR.Linear]):
// lights come in through PBRLight / PBRAmbient, the albedo through LinColor, physical colours (the transmittance) through
// SkinLinearColor. Direct lighting works in whatever space the caller's vectors share (SkinTemplate: tangent space); the sky
// terms take WORLD-space vectors. Derivatives are taken in SkinSetup only, which must be called at the pixel shader's top level.
