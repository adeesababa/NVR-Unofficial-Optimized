// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-20 grass field wind ([Shaders.Grass.Wind], core/GrassWind.h; OFF by default; bench\deep-roadmap\evidence\
// grasswind-LOG.md). The grass moves like a field in the wind: gusts roll across it along the weather's wind like waves through
// wheat, each tuft flutters a little on its own so neighbours never move in lockstep, and the game's own sway is turned onto the
// weather's wind direction -- the direction cloth uses (core/ClothWind.h: sky->windDirection), so the grass and the coats agree.
// (The game sways all grass along one fixed axis whatever the weather: Sky::UpdateWind 0x0063C490 sets NiPoint2::UNIT_Y.)
// Strength: multiples of the game's own sway at that vertex (WindData.z x vertex alpha^2). The game makes WindData.z
// fGrassWindMagnitudeMin + sky->windSpeed x (Max - Min) (ShadowSceneNode::PreOnVisible; INI 5 / 125): the weather's wind speed,
// the same source cloth scales by, and each grass model's own authored sway (its vertex alpha) is kept.
//
// Per draw NVR sets (core/GrassWind.h):
//   lanes  x, y the gust wave vector: the wind direction x 2 pi / GustSize (radians per unit); z the gust lean, w the flutter (both
//          times the game's sway). x = y = 0: off -- the callers run none of this (a branch on lanes.xy): the game's sway exactly.
//          The card shaders (GRASS23x00*.vso) have no free constant register: the lanes ride in the 4th column of the inverse view
//          matrix rows (c252.w-c255.w), which the shadow lookup never reads (GetShadowWorldPos returns mul(v, InvView).xyz). Unwritten
//          (the effect off) that column is the matrix's own (0, 0, 0, 1). NewGrass.vso has them in c253.
//   clock  radians, integrated on the CPU in double precision and wrapped at 8 pi (no jitter after long play, as the cloth's phases):
//          the gusts move at clock / 4 and the flutter at 2 x clock, so both wrap whole. The card shaders read it from c19.z, which
//          the sandstorm's grass wind shares (GrassWind.h blends the clock's rate to the storm's while a storm blows).
//
// Shape: the gust front is (0.5 + 0.5 sin(clock / 4 - P.K))^2 (sharp crests, the troughs at rest, so the field leans downwind as each
// gust passes and straightens behind it), times a patch wave 45 degrees off the wind at 1.4x the length (0.75 + 0.25 sin), so the
// fronts break into patches instead of running in endless straight bands. A sum of travelling waves as Sousa's vegetation animation
// (GPU Gems 3 ch. 16, 2007) and the cloth wind here; sin rather than ClothTri: the grass shaders hold no literal 3.
// P is the tuft's WORLD position (InstanceData xy: TallGrassShaderProperty::AddGrass, nv-rs grass.rs), so the waves run on across the
// grass groups without a seam. Flutter: per tuft, its phase from its random size step and brightness (inst.w) and its place.
// Only literals the grass shaders already hold (0.25 0.5 0.75 2 1/128 1e-6): one more spills past c255 and the game refuses the shader.

// Grass collision ([Shaders.Grass.Collision], effects/GrassCollision.cpp), shared by the card shaders and NewGrass.vso so a strand is
// pushed as its card is at the same height: how much of the push (the grid's value, the push at a blade's tip) a point takes, by its
// height above the tuft's root: none at the root, all of it from 50 units up (2026-10-20: it was the card's vertex alpha squared,
// 0.02-0.5 at the tips of the Mojave's grass models, so most grass hardly moved). Written with the literals the card shaders already
// hold (0.01, 2; the inner saturate keeps the compiler from folding them into a new one): GRASS23x002/003 have no literal slot left.

    return saturate(saturate(height * 0.01f) * 2.0f);

// The whole move of a vertex in the field wind: the game's sway (swing as the game computes it, of the game's size) turned onto the
// wind direction, plus the gust lean along the wind and the flutter along it and half as much across, all times the game's sway size
// and the vertex weight (the game's: vertex alpha squared); z drops as the blade leans so it bends rather than stretches (height = the
// vertex's height above the tuft's root, as the grass collision does). windData = the game's c4 (xy its sway axis, z its size).
