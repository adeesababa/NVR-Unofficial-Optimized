// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-13: blood on the first-person weapon and gloves (src/effects/HandBlood.{h,cpp}, [Shaders.HandBlood]).
// The idea and the way it is wired are mrfury97's HUD raindrops (Physically-Based-Reloaded testbed, commit dc5fa758, after
// Screen Space Shaders' HUD raindrops by Ascii1457): drawn by the meshes' own shaders, so the blood stays on the surface
// through every animation; placed by the mesh's texture coordinates, scaled by how many game units a texture unit covers so a
// spatter is about the same size on every mesh; switched on per draw for first-person geometry only (SetShadersHook in
// NewVegas/Hooks/Render.cpp sets c218-c219, and clears them for every other draw).
// The blood itself is NVR's: a spatter drawn from hashed cells (no texture: the object shaders have no free sampler),
// three layers: fine mist, droplets (stretched along the spray) and a few bigger splotches with ragged edges. A cell shows
// once the amount passes its own threshold, so more blood fills in more of the same pattern (it never jumps around).
#ifndef HANDBLOOD_INCLUDED

// Compiled in only when [Shaders.HandBlood] is on at startup (ShaderRecord.cpp, HAND_BLOOD): even switched off per draw, the

// they were.
