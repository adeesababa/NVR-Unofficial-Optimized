// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-14: the physical sky's lookup table (Effects\SkyView.fx.hlsl). Filled once a frame while
// [Shaders.Sky.Physical] is on and outdoors (ShaderManager::RenderEffectsPreTonemapping); the sky shader (SKY.pso) reads it
// the next frame. Its settings and constants (TESR_PhysSky, TESR_PhysSkySun) belong to the sky shaders (Sky.cpp).
//
// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-18: with ExactSunlight or MultipleScattering on, the table is drawn by technique 3 or 4, which read two
// small STATIC tables drawn by techniques 1 (sun transmittance, 256 x 64) and 2 (multiple scattering Psi_ms, 32 x 32). They depend
// only on Haze and GroundAlbedo, so they are drawn when those change or a switch is first turned on (fixes-a #48: no periodic refresh; the render targets
// are never lost in a running session). With both switches off none of this runs and technique 0 draws as before.
