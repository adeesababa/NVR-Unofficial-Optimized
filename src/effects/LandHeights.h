// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-19: the land heights of one worldspace, read straight from the game's plugin files in load order, for
// the terrain shadows (TerrainShadows.h) when no xLODGen height map is installed. NVR's own code, no game calls: it runs on a
// worker thread and only reads the files.
//
// The plugins are walked group by group (WRLD > the world's children > exterior cell blocks > sub-blocks > a CELL and its
// children > temporary children), skipping everything else by its size, so only the CELL and LAND records of that world are
// read. A cell's LAND from a later plugin replaces an earlier one's (load order). Each LAND's VHGT holds 33 x 33 heights
// 128 units apart (the outer row and column shared with the next cell), as a start height and signed steps of 8 units; the
// first 32 x 32 of each cell are kept, as xLODGen's height maps keep them, and averaged down to the size asked for.
//
// Compressed records (zlib) are unpacked by the small inflate in LandHeights.cpp, written for this from RFC 1950/1951.
