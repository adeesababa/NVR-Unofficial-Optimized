// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-15: CREDIT Conor (mrfury97): his screen-space skin scattering, from his NVR testbed
// (github.com/mrfury97/Conor-sClaudeHell-NVR-SAL-Fork, branch testbed, src/effects/SkinScattering.h). An add-on to this build's
// skin shader (SkinTemplate.hlsl, Skin.h): [Shaders.Skin.Scattering] / [Shaders.Skin.Interiors] ScreenSpace; the SkinShader
// hooks (Hooks/Shaders.cpp) bind its targets for every skin draw. Idle while Vanilla Plus Skin's shaders are in use.
//
// Screen-space subsurface scattering for skin: Jimenez & Gutierrez's separable SSS, with the
// kernel generator ported from Community Shaders (GPL-3.0-or-later; the separable SSS itself is
// "Copyright (C) 2012 by Jorge Jimenez and Diego Gutierrez"). Blurs skin's diffuse light across
// the screen with a red-leaning skin profile, the way ENB and Community Shaders soften skin.
//
// How the skin is found without a G-buffer:
//   - During every NVR skin draw in the main scene (SkinShader's PrepareGeometryForRendering ..
//     PostGeometry, hooked in NewVegas/Hooks/Shaders.cpp), a second render target is bound.
//     The skin shader writes its highlights' share of the colour (rgb) and its camera distance
//     (a) to it, its albedo (rgb) and the luminance of the colour it drew (a) to a third, and its
//     full colour to the scene as always.
//   - This effect blurs only pixels whose stored distance matches the depth buffer and whose
//     scene colour still matches what the skin drew, so anything drawn over the skin afterwards
//     (hair cards, gear, decals, particles, with or without depth writes) is left alone. It runs
//     first in the effect chain, on the scene exactly as drawn, for that comparison. It takes the highlights out before
//     blurring and puts them back after (the skin shader's own, and since 2026-10-19 the game's own highlight passes on
//     skin, which add the same colour to the skin target as to the scene: BindForGameHighlights), and divides the albedo out before blurring and
//     multiplies it back after (Community Shaders' pre/post scatter), so only light is diffused
//     and the skin texture's detail stays sharp.
// Anything this cannot handle (fading actors, reflections, MSAA edges, the effect switched off)
// keeps the scene's own, complete colour: nothing is lost, it is only not blurred. Known gaps:
//   - an actor lit only through additive passes (blend ONE, ONE) never writes its distance, so
//     it is not blurred; the engine's base or AD pass with ambient is opaque and does write it
//   - an actor lit by several passes ends with a colour its first pass did not write, so it is
//     only blurred where a single pass lit it
//   - first-person arms are drawn outside the world scene and are not blurred
