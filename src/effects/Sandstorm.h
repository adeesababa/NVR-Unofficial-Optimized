// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-18 (sandport): ported from Physically-Based-Reloaded (github.com/Balebandro/Physically-Based-Reloaded,
// Balebandro, Alejandro Martinez), GPL-3.0, the same licence as this project: their commits 90ae7541 ('Sandstorm, grass
// interaction ...') and ebcf3c03 ('Sandstorm: dust seen through glass and blended surfaces, and from underwater'). It
// replaces the older sandstorm Fable wrote for PR #1 (shelved 2026-10-13 as too buggy). Changes for this build: the clocks
// run once per rendered frame (UpdateConstants runs twice a frame), the sun's visibility in the dust uses this build's
// cascade lookup (its PCF mode and the cascade centres), the storm wind reaches the grass through c19.y/z (the grass VS has
// no free register: GrassFirst's c19.w and the literals fill it) and the leaves through c134, and it stays OFF by default.
//
// Sandstorm, after Kappa's v5 weather update: while the weather is a sandstorm (any weather whose editor ID holds
// Keyword, "sandstorm,duststorm" by default here, in any case), the air fills with wind-driven dust. Billowing clouds of it are
// marched through near the camera and lit by the sun and sky, a dense haze swallows the distance and the sky, and
// thin streaks of sand blow past. It builds and settles with the weather's own transition.
