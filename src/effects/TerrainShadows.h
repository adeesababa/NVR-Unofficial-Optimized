// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-19 [Shaders.ShadowsExteriors.TerrainShadows]: the land's shadows on the land, far past the sun's cascades
// (mountains darkening the valleys beyond them at a low sun).
//
// Credits and licence: ported from Conor's (mrfury97) NVR fork, github.com/mrfury97/Conor-sClaudeHell-NVR-SAL-Fork, branch
// testbed (6043062a, bae95aef, 9000473d, 2026-10-16; GPL-3.0-or-later, the same licence as this project), which follows
// Community Shaders' "Terrain Shadows" (github.com/community-shaders/skyrim-community-shaders, features/Terrain Shadows,
// GPL-3.0 with the Modding and Linking exceptions; FO4 port github.com/northaxosky/fallout4-community-shaders). The worker-thread
// load and sweep below are Conor's; changed for this build: when no xLODGen height map is installed, the heights are read
// straight from the plugins in load order (LandHeights.h, this build's own code), and the result is applied by the
// SunFar pass (SunFar.h) to the sun's share of the light only.
//
// The xLODGen height map (FNVLODGen: Terrain LOD > Height maps), one per worldspace, is used when present:
//   Data\Textures\Terrain\<Worldspace>\<Worldspace>.HeightMap.<S>.<W>.<N>.<E>.<min z>.<max z>.dds
// 16-bit, 32 points per cell (128 units apart), 32767 = height 0, steps of 8 units.
//
// The heights are read on a worker thread when the worldspace changes (shrunk to MaxResolution a side by averaging). From
// them, each texel's shadow height -- below it the sun is hidden by land between it and the sun -- is swept toward the sun
// on a worker thread whenever the sun has moved a little: each texel takes the higher of its own height and the shadow
// height of the texel before it on the light's path, lowered by how far the light drops over one step. Two channels, the
// sun's elevation minus and plus Softness, give the soft edge; the map's own ground height is kept beside them. The SunFar
// pass compares each pixel's height with them, never taking a pixel as lower than that ground: the LOD land on screen is
// simplified and sits below the map in places, which would otherwise shadow itself (and flicker with TAA's jitter).
