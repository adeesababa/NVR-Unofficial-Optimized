// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-26 BloodFluid ("BloodFlow v2"; [Shaders.BloodFlow.Fluid], off by default; needs NVR DXVK, the NVR extension
// on DXVK's d3d9.dll, core/DxvkCompute.h). Fresh blood becomes a real fluid: a particle simulation run as Vulkan compute work in
// DXVK's own command stream (src/hlsl/NewVegas/Compute/BloodFluidSim.comp), painted with BloodFlow's look
// (BloodFluidDraw.frag). Drips run down walls and gather under ledges and drop off them, pools under bodies spread and settle,
// then everything stops and dries into stains.
//  - Where blood comes from: what BloodFlow already reads from the game. A fresh blood splat (on screen when it appears) is
//    thrown at its surface along the way the game threw it; a body that has just died bleeds a pool on the ground under it
//    (BloodFlow then does not draw its own pool for that body). With ReplaceStreams BloodFlow's painted streams and splat drips
//    are off while the fluid is on (the fluid's runs replace them); the game's decal and BloodFlow's splat shape stay.
//  - Without NVR DXVK (native D3D9, stock DXVK) or with the setting off, nothing here runs and BloodFlow is exactly as before.
// Ideas from gwater2 (meetric, GPL-3.0; no code copied) and NVIDIA's "Screen Space Fluid Rendering" (2009); the 2026-10-22
// spike's D3D9 prototype (work\bench\deep-roadmap\evidence\fluidsim) is the model: its numbers are kept.
//
// Kept out of BloodFlow.h (a widely included header): BloodFlow.cpp includes this and calls TheBloodFluid().
