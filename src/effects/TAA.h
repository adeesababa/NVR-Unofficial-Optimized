// Temporal anti-aliasing: temporal accumulation with camera reprojection, plus sub-pixel jitter of
// the world render so a still image gets anti-aliased too. Ported from Oblivion Reloaded E3's TAA;
// see TAA.fx.hlsl for what changed and why, and BeginJitter below for how the jitter is applied.
//
// Two passes per frame, both full resolution:
//   Resolve: current frame + reprojected history (one FP16 buffer) -> the other FP16 buffer
//   Output:  that buffer -> the frame; it is next frame's history
// Resolve cannot write the history it is reading, hence two buffers. UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-13: they take turns (historyIndex)
// instead of the resolve being copied into a fixed history buffer every frame (a full-screen FP16 copy, about 0.15 ms at
// 1440p, for the same result). The history is FP16
// rather than the frame's 8 bits because at a 0.9 blend weight each frame moves the history only
// 10% of the way to the current value, and in 8 bits any difference under about 5/255 rounds
// straight back to the old value -- a ghost that stops fading and never clears.
