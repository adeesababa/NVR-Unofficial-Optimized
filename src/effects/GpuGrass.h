// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-27 GPU grass ([Shaders.Grass.GPUGrass], OFF by default; NVR DXVK 1.7-grass, fork patch 0024; docs\next\FORK2-GRASS.md).
// Grass strands placed, culled and counted on the graphics card, then drawn with ONE indirect draw per level of detail, into the game's
// own scene with its depth buffer, instead of the game's alpha-tested grass cards.
//
// Placement is the game's: during GrassFirst's early grass call (Render.cpp namespace GrassFirst, the near tufts before the land) every
// card draw is caught at its DrawIndexedPrimitive (as NewGrass does), its instance table (the tufts the game placed for that grass type
// on that piece of land: position, slope, size step, brightness) and the card's own colour and silhouette per height (read once from
// its texture, NewGrass::GetRamp) are recorded, and the card draw is skipped (KeepCards false) or kept (KeepCards true: the strands are
// added round it). Right after that call one compute pass turns every recorded tuft into a clump of strands (Density: more clumps of the
// same plant beside each tuft), culls the clumps against the view, gives each its strand count by distance and writes the visible strands
// and the draw counts; two indirect draws (near strands 5 triangles, far 1) then put them into the frame with the game's depth test, lit
// exactly as the game's own grass pixel shader lights the cards, in NVR's grass wind ([Shaders.Grass.Wind]) or the game's sway.
// The fading tufts past the fade start stay the game's cards (drawn after the land as before), as does every piece farther than
// BladeDistance, any grass that is not a cut-out card (rocks and debris placed as grass) and all grass while GrassFirst does not run.
//
// Needs the NVR DXVK d3d9.dll with ID3D9NvrExtGeometryScene (1.7-grass); without it (native D3D9, stock DXVK, an older NVR DXVK)
// nothing is caught or skipped and the grass is the game's. Off: no code path touches the device.
