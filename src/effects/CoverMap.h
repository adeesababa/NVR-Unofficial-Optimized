// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-27 Persistent wetness and snow cover (deep/fork2-wetsnow). [Shaders.WetWorld.Main] Persistent and
// [Shaders.SnowAccumulation.Main] Persistent, both off by default (off = exactly the old behaviour: the old techniques, the old
// constants, nothing of this runs or is allocated).
//
// The cover map (Effects\CoverMap.fx.hlsl): a top-down map round the camera that keeps, per spot, how wet the top surface is, how
// full its puddles are, how deep its snow lies and how hard that snow has been trodden (one texture, the readers'), plus that
// surface's height and whether it lay in shade (a second texture drawn in the same pass). Heights come from the ortho map (the
// top-down depth map the rain and snow effects already draw) where it holds something, else from the camera's depth (the ortho map
// holds no land at all). It is world-fixed and wraps round, so it never has to be moved: when the camera moves, only the
// texels whose spot left the window start again, from the open-ground values kept here on the CPU (which follow the same rules for
// an open, sunlit spot). Rain and snow build up on every spot's top surface; spots dry and melt over game time, faster in the sun,
// slower in shade (a short march towards the sun over the map's own heights) and at night; snow gathers in hollows and against
// walls; the player's feet tread a trail into the snow. WetWorld (techniques 5/6) and SnowAccumulation (technique 1) read the map
// instead of their single amount; outside the window they use the open-ground values. Their own top-surface tests (the ortho map)
// still decide which pixels are the top surface, so ground under a roof stays dry.
// Plain D3D9 render-target ping-pong (two pairs of A16B16G16R16 maps, two render targets at once), so it works on native D3D9 and
// through DXVK alike. The map belongs to
// one exterior worldspace: another worldspace, a loaded save (game time going back) or more than 72 game hours at once start it again.
//
// Not in Effects.h on purpose (the class layouts every file sees stay as they were): the effect is reached through TheCoverMap,
// registered in ShaderManager::Initialize like the others (no settings section of its own, so it is always on when its file loads).
