// UNOFFICIAL, testbed (2026-10-13): a police body-camera look (Shaders > Bodycam, off by default). At the very end of the chain,
// after anti-aliasing and the cinema overlay: a wide lens that bends straight lines (fisheye, scaled so no black corners
// show), colour fringes towards the edges, the camera's oversharpening halos, highlights that bloom and clip, punchy but
// washed-out colour with a faint green cast, sensor noise and video-compression blocks (mostly in the dark), a vignette, and
// a timestamp in the corner (the game's date and clock) drawn from a small texture this effect writes when the text changes.
// Also: a soft black oval round the frame, the cheap lens blurring towards its edges, overexposure, a smear when the view
// turns (from the player's turn since last frame, as MotionBlur), and lens dirt lit up by bright light.
