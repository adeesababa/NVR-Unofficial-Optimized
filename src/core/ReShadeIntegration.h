// combined depth (the world and the first-person model in one buffer, in the game's own depth direction; with
// ReShade's D3D9 runtime, or since 2026-10-18 its Vulkan runtime under DXVK), draws ReShade's effects right after
// NVR's own, before the HUD, instead of ReShade drawing them over it (D3D9 runtime), and can pause chosen ReShade
// effects while menus are open (ReShadeMenuGuard).
