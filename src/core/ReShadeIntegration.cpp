// UNOFFICIAL: NVR as a ReShade add-on. Each job has its own switch in [Main.Main.Performance]:
//
//   ReShadeNVRDepth: ReShade's DEPTH texture becomes a copy of NVR's combined depth. ReShade's Generic Depth
//   only sees the game's depth buffer, which the game clears before it draws the first-person model, so the gun
//   and arms are missing from it (depth effects shade or blur across them). NVR's combined depth already holds
//   the world and the first-person model in one buffer, in main-camera space. It is written back in the
//   direction of the game's own depth buffer, so the RESHADE_DEPTH_INPUT_* settings that fit the game still fit.
//
//   ReShadeDepthNearRemap (2026-10-18): the first-person model is drawn with its own, closer near plane, so in the
//   world camera's projection its depth lies past the near plane (reversed projected depth g > 1). ReShade.fxh-style
//   decoders then get a negative linear depth. The copy folds that band back below 1 with a monotone map: identity
//   for g <= 0.5 (everything farther than about twice the world near plane: every normal world and LOD pixel comes
//   out bit-identical), 1 - 1/(4g) above (value and slope continuous at 0.5, ordered, < 1); negative or non-finite
//   values become sky. The map is adapted from NVR Depth Bridge (MIT, NVR Depth Bridge contributors), notice below.
//
//   ReShadeBeforeHUD: ReShade normally draws its effects when the frame is presented, after the HUD and menus.
//   effect_runtime::render_effects called right after NVR's effects draws them there instead, and ReShade then
//   skips its own draw for that frame. Frames where NVR's image space does not run (main menu, loading screens)
//   keep ReShade's usual draw at present. D3D9 runtime only.
//
//   ReShadeMenuGuard (2026-10-18, off by default): the effect files named in ReShadeMenuGuardEffects are paused while
//   a menu, the Pip-Boy (and with ReShadeMenuGuardVATS, VATS) is open. Only techniques that are on when ReShade
//   starts its effects are switched off, and exactly those are switched on again right after the effects, before
//   ReShade's overlay or preset can see the change (nothing is ever saved). Menu state from the game's own
//   InterfaceManager. Design after NVR Depth Bridge's MenuGuard.
//
//   ReShadeGameValues (2026-10-25, on by default; only effects that ask for them see a difference): uniforms with
//   source = "ModLoaded" / "Weather" / "WorldspaceID" / "InteriorID" get the game's values, the names FNV ReShade
//   Helper (doodlum and Wall_SoGB, github.com/doodlum/fnv-reshade-helper) uses, so presets written for it work with NVR.
//   Weather = (current weather form ID, previous weather form ID, transition 0..1, game hour); IDs are the low 24
//   bits of the form ID (no load-order byte). Written from scratch: that repository carries no licence.
//
// Two ReShade runtimes are served (the game has one swap chain, so one of them):
//   D3D9 (ReShade installed as d3d9.dll, also when DXVK sits behind it): view handles are the D3D9 objects themselves
//   (the low bit marks the sRGB variant). DEPTH is bound in reshade_begin_effects and unbound after the effects.
//   Vulkan (2026-10-18, ReShade as a Vulkan layer under DXVK): NVR's copy texture is a VkImage inside DXVK. Its handle
//   and DXVK's resting layout come from DXVK's ID3D9VkInteropTexture (asked on the render thread right after the copy
//   and published with a generation number); ReShade's events run on DXVK's presenting thread, where a resource view
//   of that image is made through the ReShade API and bound to DEPTH. The image is moved to the shader-read layout in
//   reshade_begin_effects and back to DXVK's layout in reshade_finish_effects, inside ReShade's own present command
//   list (no submissions of our own, no DXVK flush). ReShade waits for the GPU in update_texture_bindings on Vulkan,
//   so DEPTH stays bound across frames there: it is rebound only after an effect reload, when something else rebound
//   DEPTH, or for a new image, and unbound when NVR stops providing it (switch off, no new copy for a few presents).
//   The Vulkan side never holds a D3D9 object: only the VkImage handle and its own view. NVR's texture lives for the
//   whole session (NVR does not recreate its targets on a device reset).
//
// The events used (init/destroy_effect_runtime and the reshade_* ones) are allowed in ReShade's normal build,
// not only the one with full add-on support. The register call is made directly (not reshade::register_addon)
// to accept a ReShade older than these headers: it is tried from RESHADE_API_VERSION down; only interface
// methods that exist since API version 1 are used. ReShade's exports use the default (cdecl) convention.
