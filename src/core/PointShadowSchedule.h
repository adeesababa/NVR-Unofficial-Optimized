// Decides which point-light shadow cubemap slots are redrawn on a frame.
//
// Every slot's cubemap is rendered from scratch each frame by default. With an update interval N > 1
// a slot is redrawn only every N frames (staggered by slot so the cost is spread out) and keeps its
// previous contents in between -- but only while it still describes the same light: the slot must hold
// the same light object at the same position and radius, in the same cell, and the same texture, or it
// is redrawn at once. P41 also reuses a complete all-static caster set indefinitely and invalidates it
// from a hash of geometry identity, transforms, bounds, visibility and material alpha. A list containing
// actors/animated leaves keeps the old interval schedule. Kept free of engine types so tests can check it.

// to move their shadows, so lamps near people cost a full redraw most frames. Now such a slot keeps a second, "static"
// cube map drawn from the casters that never move (the ones PointShadowCasterState hashes), and a refresh copies it into
