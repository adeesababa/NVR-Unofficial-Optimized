// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-27 RenderScale v2 (docs/next/RENDERSCALE-V2.md; user: "shouldn't everything in the image be rendered lower then
// upscaled?"). With [Shaders.TAA.FSR] / [Shaders.TAA.DLSS] RenderScale below 1, the world scene, the first-person weapon and NVR's
// effects before tonemapping all draw at the lower internal resolution, into the TOP-LEFT part of their full-size targets, and FSR 2 /
// DLSS upscale the frame at the end of ShaderManager::RenderEffectsPreTonemapping, before the game's image space. Nothing is
// reallocated: a screen-shaped texture keeps its size and the effects use its top-left ScaleX x ScaleY part. Shaders see the same
// numbers as TESR_RenderScale (xy = Scale, zw = 1 / Scale; Includes/RenderRect.hlsl). Off: On false, Scale 1, every helper a no-op.
//
// The state is set by TAAEffect (effects/TAAUpscale.cpp): Begin after a world scene drawn small, End right after the upscale.
