// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-20 grass field wind ([Shaders.Grass.Wind], OFF by default: a look change the user judges). Shaders:
// Includes/GrassWind.hlsl (the maths), GRASS23x000-003.vso (the game's grass cards), NewGrass.vso (NewGrass strands). Plan, limits
// and results: bench\deep-roadmap\evidence\grasswind-LOG.md.
//
// The grass moves like a field in the wind instead of every tuft swaying on its own: gusts roll across the field along the weather's
// wind like waves through wheat (always, stronger and faster as the weather's wind rises), each tuft flutters a little on its own so
// neighbours never move in lockstep, and the game's own sway is turned onto the weather's wind direction. Direction and wind speed
// are the ones cloth uses (core/ClothWind.h: sky->windDirection as an angle, sky->windSpeed 0-1), so the grass and the coats agree;
// the game itself sways all grass along world +Y whatever the weather (TallGrassShader::SetupTransformations 0x00BAAC10, from
// WallSoGB's map). Strength: multiples of the game's own sway (fGrassWindMagnitudeMin + windSpeed x (Max - Min) times the model's
// vertex alpha squared), so every grass model keeps its authored stiffness. Idea credited: the cloth wind here and Sousa's
// travelling-wave vegetation animation (GPU Gems 3 ch. 16, 2007); the sandstorm's grass gusts (Physically-Based-Reloaded, GPL-3.0)
// were the first moving fronts in this shader.
//
// Constants (see GrassWind.hlsl): the card shaders have no free register, so the four lanes (gust wave vector xy, gust lean,
// flutter) ride in the 4th column of the inverse view matrix rows c252-c255, which the shadow lookup never reads; SetForDraw writes
// those rows right after the shader's constant upload (same SetShadersHook). Off, nothing is written: that column is the matrix's
// own 0 0 0 1 (RenderManager builds it so), the shaders' branch is not taken and the grass sways exactly as the game's.
// The clock goes to c19.z, which the sandstorm's grass wind shares (its gusts at clock / 4, flutter at clock): while a storm blows
// the clock runs at a blend of this wind's rate and the storm's 8.4 rad/s, so the storm's grass keeps its pace.
// Phases are integrated from the game's clock in double precision and wrapped (8 pi: the gusts at clock / 4 and the flutter at
// 2 x clock both wrap whole), as ClothWind.h does: a pause or menu stops them, the time scale does not change the speed, and the
// motion never jitters after long play.
