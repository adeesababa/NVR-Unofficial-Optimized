// NVR_FOLD; bench\deep-roadmap\evidence\pbrtiles\LOG.md).
//
// User report 2026-10-21 (Lucky 38 casino floor): "pbr seems to apply more to some tiles even though they're supposed to be the same type
// of tile". The game draws a shiny object reached by 0-2 lamps in ONE pass (NVR's full PBR shader: the lamps summed in linear light, metal,
// the PBR diffuse) and one reached by 3 or more in SEVERAL: a light-only pass (BSSM_AD3: the sun, the first lamps, the ambient), extra lamp
// passes (DIFFUSEPT2/3), a texture pass that MULTIPLIES what is there by the colour (TEXTURE / TEXTURE_Vc), highlight passes ADDED after
// it (2x_SPECULARDIR / PT / PT2 / PT3) and fog. With linear lighting each highlight pass is encoded on its own, so a small highlight comes
// out several times too strong (1% light -> 12% stored), and those passes have no metal and the plain diffuse: two identical floor pieces,
// one reached by 2 lamps and its neighbour by 3, look different. Measured at the user's spot (run 20261021-014725): the highlight passes'
// stored-curve sum is nearly all of the difference (fixed alone: the several-pass pieces 0.44x as bright; the lamp passes' sum: 1.00x).
//
// On: for each shiny object NVR's light-only and extra-lamp shaders draw (non-FaceGen, non-hair, non-parallax, no glow map, world scene,
// inside the highlight distance), those passes work their lamps' light out as the one-pass shader does (diffuse + highlight + metal) and
// divide it by the colour the texture pass then multiplies in, so each pass ends up holding its lamps' light exactly as one pass would;
// the object's highlight passes are then skipped (their highlights are already drawn). Per draw: NVR_SpecFade (c211) y = 1 (fold) and
// z = 1 when the game's texture pass multiplies the vertex colour too (the property's Vertex_Colors flag); for the extra-lamp passes the
// object's base texture is bound on sampler 3 (they have only the normal map; nothing else of theirs uses 3). What stays: the lamps of each extra-lamp pass are still
// added to the rest in the stored curve (their highlights now with them), much smaller here. Off (live): every draw exactly as before.
