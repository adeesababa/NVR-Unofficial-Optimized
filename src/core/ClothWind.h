// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-16 cloth wind ([Shaders.Cloth.Main]; shaders: Includes/ClothWind.hlsl, ObjectTemplate.hlsl, ShadowMap.vso).
//
// Capes, dusters, flags, banners and curtains move in the wind, done entirely in the vertex shader by maths (a travelling smooth
// triangle wave for the billow, a slow gust, a two-wave ripple at the flutter speed), weighted per vertex by the vertex colour's
// RED channel (1 = loose ends, 0 = pinned) or the whole mesh (MaskMode 1). No physics, nothing per vertex on the CPU.
// Which objects: those whose diffuse texture path contains one of the Keywords (cached per texture). Per draw this sets the
// vertex shader constants c248-c251 (strength 0 for everything else, so other objects run no wind code at all).
// The wind: the settings' direction and speed, or the game's own (the sky's wind speed and direction, UseGameWind).
// Phases are worked out here in double precision and wrapped, so the motion never jitters after long play.
// 2026-10-17 (cloth round 2): the phases are INTEGRATED from the game's clock (a pause or menu stops them, the time scale does not
// change the speed) instead of being a speed times the hour of the day: that clock was in game seconds / 1000, i.e. 30x too slow in
// play (the billow crept at 6 units/s, the 3 Hz flutter at 0.09 Hz), it jumped back at midnight, and every change of the weather's
// wind speed made the phase jump (time x new speed). Test knob TimeOffset (seconds) shifts the pattern for time-step pictures.
// The vertex shader works in the object's space for static meshes (the wind is turned into it with the object's rotation and
// scale); for skinned ones in the skin root's space in the game's passes and in world space in NVR's shadow pass (its own bones).
// SAFETY: every pass of an object must move it the same way (lamp passes test depth EQUAL). Some passes use the game's own
// (vanilla) vertex shaders, which do not move it -- the texture pass of multi-pass objects then misses and the cloth turns white.
// So an object gets cloth only if, last frame, every one of its passes had an NVR vertex shader (SetShadersHook notes them).
// Interiors: no wind, so no cloth (2026-10-21: unless [Shaders.Cloth.Interiors] is on: its own gentle values, see BeginFrame).
// 2026-10-18 (cloth round 3, 'cloth does nothing'): keywords match as substrings (with an exclusion list), worn clothing is masked by
// the garment's own BIND-POSE height (pinned shoulders, loose hem), the calm-weather strength is higher, and non-cloth draws can no
// longer inherit c248 from the grass shaders (they relocate their shadow matrices to c248..c255). See evidence\cloth3-LOG.md.
// 2026-10-19 (cloth round 5): worn clothing by a per-vertex weight from its own mesh (ClothWeights.h, mask 5), delivered as vertex
// stream 1 around the skinned partition draw (DrawPartition); the skeleton mask (4) stays the fallback. evidence\cloth3-LOG.md C3-11.
// 2026-10-20 (cloth round 9): worn coats hang from the hips and their hem is simulated while walking (ClothWalk.h, WalkOf). C3-15.
// 2026-10-20 (user's video: 'the entire tent mesh wobbles around'; 'only move thin parts of static cloth objects'): still cloth by a
// per-vertex weight from its own mesh (ClothStatic.h, mask 6: poles, ropes and solid parts still, the cloth held where it touches them,
// the ground and its top line, loosest at its free edges), worked out once per mesh on a worker thread and delivered as vertex stream
// 1 around the game's still-object draw (NiDX9Renderer::Do_OnlyRenderShape / Do_OnlyRenderTristrips: OnlyRender). See StillOf.
