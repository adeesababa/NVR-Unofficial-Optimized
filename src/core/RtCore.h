// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-28 (NVR DXVK): the ray tracing core shared by NVR's RT effects (docs\next\FORK-RT-CORE.md).
//
// Windows' 32-bit Vulkan drivers offer no ray tracing, so the scene lives in a 64-bit helper, NvrRtHelper.exe (tools\nvr-rt-helper),
// on the same GPU. Every frame, at one point of the frame (RtCore::Frame, after the depth and normals exist, before the sun shadows),
// the core:
//   1. gathers the scene: the opaque static geometry of the loaded cells within [Main.Main.RayTracing] SceneRadius of the camera
//      (land and objects; not actors, alpha-tested or blended geometry, SpeedTree leaves, decals): each new geometry is converted
//      by the fork (ID3D9NvrExtRt::StageGeometry) into the shared arena image and built ONCE in the helper; each frame only the
//      instance list (camera-relative transforms) goes over;
//   2. asks every RT effect (a User) that wants to trace this frame to record: CopyIn its inputs into shared images, AddPass its
//      trace passes (compute shaders run by the helper), CopyOut its results into NVR textures;
//   3. records, in DXVK's command stream: the arena copy, the inputs, "inputs ready" = N, a GPU wait for "output ready" = N, the
//      outputs. Nothing waits on the CPU.
// Off (no user wants RT), native D3D9, stock DXVK, a fork without patch 0028, a GPU without ray tracing for 64-bit programs, or no
// helper: nothing runs and the users keep their old paths (the reason is logged once). A helper that dies or stops answering is
// ended by a watchdog thread, which releases the GPU wait; RT is then off for the session.
//
// Coordinates: scene space = world space minus the camera position (TheRenderManager->CameraPosition), Gamebryo units, z up;
// RenderManager::CreateD3DMatrix's convention. A trace pass gets what it needs to reconstruct positions in its own constants.
