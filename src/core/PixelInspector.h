// UNOFFICIAL 2026-10-26 (debugging tool, needs NVR DXVK 1.5-debug = fork patch 0016 (0015 before the 10-27 renumbering); docs\next\FORK-DEBUG-PIXEL.md).
//
// The pixel inspector: [Main.Develop.PixelInspector] Enabled, X, Y, LogEvery. For one screen pixel it records the value that pixel
// has at every stage NVR can see during a frame: the scene before NVR (HDR), the linear depth, the view normal, the picture after
// each NVR effect that drew (and the effects' own buffers, e.g. the shadow buffer the shadow passes write), the tonemapped picture
// and the final picture before the HUD. Each stage is one tiny compute dispatch (Compute\PixelInspect.comp: the 3x3 texels round
// the pixel into a storage buffer); the buffer is read back a few frames later through the non-waiting readback
// (core\ShaderCounters.h DebugReadbackRing), so the game never waits for it. Results: an ImGui window while the overlay is open
// (pick the pixel with the mouse there) and the log ("PIXEL INSPECTOR" lines when the pixel changes, and every LogEvery frames).
// Shot lists: 'inspect <x> <y>' (core\SettingShots.h).
//
// Off (the default), or on native D3D9 / stock DXVK / an NVR DXVK without 1.5-debug: nothing is created and each hook is one bool
// test (Active). Without the extension the log says once that it needs NVR DXVK, and the window says so.
