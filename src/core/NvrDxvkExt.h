// NVR copy of the NVR DXVK fork's src/d3d9/d3d9_nvr_ext_api.h (tools/nvr-dxvk). Keep both files identical.

/*
 * NVR extension for DXVK's D3D9 device ("NVR DXVK").
 *
 * This header is the whole public contract between New Vegas Reloaded (NVR) and
 * an NVR-built DXVK d3d9.dll. It is kept free of Vulkan and DXVK types so that
 * NVR can include it as is (MSVC, 32-bit) next to <d3d9.h>. A copy of this file
 * lives in the NVR repository; keep both identical.
 *
 * How it works: everything an NVR call records goes through DXVK's own command
 * stream (the "dxvk-cs" thread) and so runs in order with the D3D9 work before
 * and after it. DXVK handles image layouts, barriers and resource lifetimes.
 * No CPU/GPU wait is involved unless a method says so.
 *
 * Usage: query ID3D9NvrExt from the IDirect3DDevice9 with QueryInterface.
 * Stock DXVK and native D3D9 return E_NOINTERFACE; callers fall back to their
 * D3D9 path.
 *
 * Resource slots: a pipeline's bindings name a Slot (0..NVR_EXT_MAX_SLOTS-1)
 * per binding type family. Images, buffers and samplers each have their own
 * slot space. A dispatch binds resources to those slots. The slots are
 * independent of anything D3D9 binds, so a dispatch never disturbs the game's
 * or NVR's D3D9 state.
 *
 * Push constants: the shader's push_constant block starts at offset 0 and may
 * hold up to NVR_EXT_MAX_PUSH_BYTES. Sampler bindings take their sampler-heap
 * index from a uint member of that block (PushOffset). The low 16 bits hold the
 * index; mask with 0xFFFF in the shader. The host side fills those dwords in,
 * the push data passed to Dispatch is copied over the whole block first.
 *
 * Shader conventions (GLSL, compiled with glslangValidator -V --target-env vulkan1.1):
 *   layout(set = S, binding = B) uniform sampler s_samplers[];   // sampler heap, if samplers are used
 *   layout(set = S, binding = B) uniform texture2D  t_src;       // NVR_EXT_BIND_SAMPLED_IMAGE
 *   layout(set = S, binding = B, rgba16f) uniform image2D i_dst; // NVR_EXT_BIND_STORAGE_IMAGE
 *   layout(set = S, binding = B, std430) buffer Foo { ... };    // NVR_EXT_BIND_STORAGE_BUFFER
 *   layout(set = S, binding = B, std140) uniform Bar { ... };   // NVR_EXT_BIND_UNIFORM_BUFFER
 *   layout(push_constant) uniform Push { ...; uint sampler_index; ... };
 * The set/binding numbers are the shader's own; DXVK remaps them. Use any
 * values, but each (set, binding) pair must be unique and listed in the
 * pipeline description.

 * the shader from this SPIR-V instead of converting the bytecode; everything the game sets for the
 * shader (constants, textures, sampler states, render states) keeps flowing. The original
 * bytecode's analysis (which samplers and render targets it uses) stays in force, so the

 * NVR registers, before the D3D9 shaders are created (as for 1.2's replacements):
 *  - a vertex shader with a tessellation control shader (TCS, 3 control points) under a family number;
 *  - pixel shaders of the same family, each with its tessellation evaluation shader (TES), one per
 *    output winding.
 * A draw whose vertex and pixel shaders were registered under the same family, drawn as a triangle list
 * (indexed or not) while SetTessState enables it, runs VS -> TCS -> TES -> PS from a patch list of 3
 * control points. A triangle strip from DrawPrimitive / DrawIndexedPrimitive is drawn as three patch lists
 * over its index windows from its first, second and third index (together every strip triangle once):
 * the TCS's p[7] (ControlParams[7], DXVK's own) is then the window 0 / 1 / 2, and -1 for a triangle list;
 * patch gl_PrimitiveID of window k is strip triangle k + 3 * gl_PrimitiveID, and the TCS must swap the first
 * two control points of the odd ones (their winding is reversed in a strip). Every other draw is untouched
 * (fans, strips from the UP draws: counted in the stats, drawn as they are).
 * The vertex shader is still DXVK's conversion of the D3D9 bytecode: the TCS reads its outputs, the TES
 * writes what the pixel shader reads, at the D3D9 semantic locations (0 NORMAL0, 1..8 TEXCOORD0..7,
 * 9/10 COLOR0/1, 11 FOG; vec4 each). At the first such draw of a pair DXVK checks that the TCS reads only
 * what the vertex shader writes and that the TES writes everything the pixel shader reads from the vertex
 * shader; a pair that fails is logged once and always drawn untessellated.
 *

 *   Both push_constant blocks start at offset 32 (layout(offset = 32) on the first member): offsets 0-31 are D3D9's

/*
 * Ray tracing core ("1.8-rt", fork patch 0028; docs/next/FORK-RT-CORE.md in the NVR repository).
 *
 * Acceleration structures built from the game's own D3D9 vertex/index buffers, and ray queries (GLSL
 * GL_EXT_ray_query) in NVR's passes. A separate interface, queried from ID3D9NvrExt with its GUID, so a
 * d3d9.dll without it answers E_NOINTERFACE and the rest of the extension is untouched.
 *
 * Feature detection: the fork enables VK_KHR_acceleration_structure + VK_KHR_ray_query (with
 * VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations; buffer device addresses DXVK already requires) only when dxvk.conf says
 * `nvr.rayTracing = True` AND the GPU's driver offers them to this (32-bit) process. Default False: measured
 * 2026-10-28, AMD's and NVIDIA's 32-bit Windows drivers offer no ray tracing at all, so on Windows NVR traces
 * in a 64-bit helper (MeasureGeometry / StageGeometry / FlushStagedGeometry at the end, which work everywhere).
 * Without in-process support (the default; any Pascal GPU such as the GTX 1070) GetRtInfo says Supported = FALSE
 * and CreateGeometry / CreateScene / BuildScene fail with D3DERR_NOTAVAILABLE: nothing created, nothing recorded,
 * the Vulkan device is created exactly as without this patch.
 *
 * Model:
 * - A geometry (ID3D9NvrExtRtGeometry) is one bottom-level structure: the triangles of one or more D3D9 draws
 *   of one vertex buffer (+ index buffer), in object space. CreateGeometry records, in order with the D3D9
 *   work, a copy of the positions (any stride / offset; float3, float4 or half4) and indices (16 or 32 bit;
 *   lists and strips, strips turned into lists) into the fork's own memory, then the build. The D3D9 buffers
 *   may change or go away afterwards: the structure keeps its own copy. Static geometry: a vertex buffer the
 *   game rewrites (skinning on the CPU, morphs) needs a new geometry.
 * - A scene (ID3D9NvrExtRtScene) is one top-level structure: up to MaxInstances instances of geometries,
 *   each with a 3x4 transform. BuildScene records the instance upload and a full rebuild (fast-build
 *   flavour); passes recorded after it see the new scene, passes recorded before it the old one.
 * - A pass (Draw / Dispatch / DrawGeometry ...) reads the scene through its GPU address in the push block:
 *     #extension GL_EXT_ray_query : require
 *     layout(push_constant) uniform Push { uvec2 scene; ... };       // ID3D9NvrExtRtScene::GetAddress, lo/hi
 *     rayQueryEXT q;
 *     rayQueryInitializeEXT(q, accelerationStructureEXT(scene), gl_RayFlagsTerminateOnFirstHitEXT,
 *                           0xFF, origin, tMin, direction, tMax);
 *     while (rayQueryProceedEXT(q)) { }
 *     bool hit = rayQueryGetIntersectionTypeEXT(q, true) != gl_RayQueryCommittedIntersectionNoneEXT;
 *   Compile with glslangValidator -V --target-env vulkan1.2 (ray queries need SPIR-V 1.4). No descriptor is
 *   involved (no new binding type): the address alone names the structure, and the fork keeps every structure
 *   a scene refers to alive and complete before any pass recorded after BuildScene runs.
 * - Spaces: whatever the caller uses consistently. NVR uses camera-relative world space (Gamebryo units,
 *   z up, origin at the camera), as its D3D9 passes do, so floats stay precise far from the world origin.
 *
 * Threading: like every extension method, the device's thread. All work is recorded into DXVK's command
 * stream (CS thread); nothing waits for the GPU.

 * StageGeometry with the vertices posed: each position (float3 / float4) is blended from up to 4 bones of pPalette (3 x 4
 * row-major matrices, p' = M (x, y, z, 1): straight into scene space) by the vertex's blend weights and indices, which sit
 * in the position's stream at the given byte deltas. Texels and layout as StageGeometry (positions, then the triangle
 * list; no texcoords). Stage it again every frame the actor moves; the palette is copied at the call.
